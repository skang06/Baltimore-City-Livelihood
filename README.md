## Background

[CBS Baltimore](https://baltimore.cbslocal.com/2017/07/06/life-expectancy-baltimore/) stated there are discrepancies in terms of life-expectancy in different areas of Baltimore. In fact, poorer areas of Baltimore had a life expectancy that was 20-years lower than that of richer areas. Lower life expectancy and higher rates of mortality in poorer areas indicate that people are dying prematurely when these are preventable solutions, as those in richer areas are not dying so early. This problem is important as obviously we would like to create for a more equitable society, where people's livelihoods are not affected based on where they live- especially if there are ways to do so. 

According to [Baltimore Cityâ€™s health department](https://health.baltimorecity.gov/state-health-baltimore-winter-2016/state-health-baltimore-white-paper-2017#:~:text=The%20leading%20causes%20of%20death,and%20chronic%20lower%20respiratory%20diseases), the leading cause of death in the city is heart disease. Life expectancy and mortality rates in the 44-64 age group in Baltimore can be assumed to be correlated with heart disease. 

There are many different causes of heart disease, but [The Mayo Clinic](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/heart-disease/symptoms-causes/syc-20353118) states that the most common type of heart disease, atherosclerosis, is caused by an unhealthy diet, lack of exercise, and being overweight. These are issues that are amendable. Thus, working with food system initiatives is a practical way to help. Hence, a look into various variables related to food systems in neighborhoods in the city of Baltimore was endeavored.

This is of interest to us because we are both Baltimore citizens at least until we graduate from Hopkins. We both come from areas that are economically better than Baltimore, so perhaps we could implement aspects that we have seen in our own hometowns to improve food safety in Baltimore. Furthermore, this is relevant for government officials who could learn the most effective ways to increase life expectancy and decrease rates of mortality by route of food safety. Not to mention, the leading cause of death in the United States is heart disease, so information from our analysis could help with the larger United States as well. It shouldn't be the case that you can live longer if you live in a more well-off neighborhood.
